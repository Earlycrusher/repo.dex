[B]-[/B]This IPTV Addon is untested and user input based, meaning i dont know what works or doesnt work unless you tell me.
[B]-[/B]Feel free to contact me about anything and if reporting info on these sections try to include enough info like...
Channel Menu Name, Channel Name, Your Location, and your problem.
[B]-[/B]I will update the lists of channels with modified titles to show user based info like "(Maybe Broken)" or maybe new found working urls if i can lol.
[B]-[/B]Note that contacting me about IPTV related stuff like this is best done with emails.
