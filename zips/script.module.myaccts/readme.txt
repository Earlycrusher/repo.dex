Debrid Manager

How the addon works:
Once authorization is complete a check is done for each supported addon to confirm if the addon is installed and if settings.xml exists for that addon.
If both of these checks are true your debrid data is retrieved from Debrid Manager and applied to the supported addons.

Note for users/builders:
For Debrid Manager to function correctly you need to ensure the directories containing the settings.xml for each supported addon are present in the addon_data directory.
Some addons do not create the settings.xml after installation. To create it the user first has to open the addon settings menu and then choose 'ok' for the file to be created. If it's not present Debrid Manager simply does nothing and moves on to the next addon. So make sure to add these to your build.

How to Authorize:
Open Debrid Manager and navigate to the debrid service of your choice
Select 'Authorize' and proceed to pair your account
Wait for the 'Sync is complete' notification and choose 'OK' to exit
All supported add-ons are now authorized
